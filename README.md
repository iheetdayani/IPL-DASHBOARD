Add an image
If you want to add your company logo or some other image to your dashboard, you save the image file online and link to it. Make sure security credentials aren't required to access the image file. For example, because OneDrive and SharePoint require authentication, images stored there can't be added to a dashboard this way. Also, images can't be in .svg format.

From the Add tile window, select Image > Next.

From the Add image tile window, add the image information:

a. To display a title above the image, select Display title and subtitle and enter a Title and an optional Subtitle.

b. Enter the image URL.

c. To make the tile a hyperlink, select Set custom link and enter the URL.

When colleagues click the image or title, they'll be taken to this URL.

d. Select Apply.
